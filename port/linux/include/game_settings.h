/*
GAME_SETTINGS.H

The settings of the menus' GAME SETTINGS (source/interface/ui_widget.c), each
one of config.toml's (port/linux/src/port_config.c), in the order of its
sections: display, audio, input. Changing one changes it in the running game
at once and writes it into the file (port/linux/src/game_settings.c).
Desktop builds only: Android has no GAME SETTINGS.
